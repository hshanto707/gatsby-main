# The Idea of the App

The intCount mobile app is a clever and convenient solution for local businesses, as it enables them to integrate their business information and services into a single platform. Accessible through a unique number on a map, this app simplifies the process of managing finances and promoting the business to potential customers. By consolidating various communication channels, businesses can save time and effort, and potentially improve their profitability.

The app basically allows a business owner and a potential customer to establish a business relationship through a unique number on the map. This number includes the business owner's phone number, WhatsApp number, and social media profiles. The app displays all of this information on a map, making it easy for potential customers to find the business and connect with the owner through various communication channels.

The number on the map also allows businesses to receive notifications of business opportunities and access their invoices and other relevant documents through their unique number on the map. This platform offers a comprehensive solution for managing business finances and promoting businesses to potential customers.

## Story

The idea behind Hicham creating this app is to develop a simple and straightforward system for opening up opportunities and advertising businesses using a single number or digit that is easy for everyone to remember.

Potential customers can easily search for a business's number on the map and find all the related data they need to conduct business with that store, freelancer, institution, or any other professional entity listed on the app. The app's platform provides a convenient way for potential customers to access all the relevant information about a business in one place, making it easier for them to engage with and potentially transact with the business.

The app's comprehensive platform provides a one-stop-shop for managing all aspects of a business's operations, enabling business owners to save time and effort while increasing their visibility to potential customers.
